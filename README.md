# exiftool-vendored

This is a cross-platform `npm` package for [ExifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/).

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/exiftool-vendored.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/exiftool-vendored)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mceachen/exiftool-vendored.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mceachen/exiftool-vendored)


## Installation

    npm install --save exiftool-vendored

An ExifTool instance will manage a child process of exiftool, and, given batch commands, will return promises of the responses.

## Usage

```javascript
    import { ExifTool } from "ExiftoolVendored"

    // ExifTool construction is expensive and stateless; 
    // Optimally use it as a node-process singleton. 
    const exiftool = new ExifTool() 

    // .read() returns a Promise of the exiftool
    exiftool.read("path/to/file.jpg").then(exif => {
      console.log(`Make: ${exif.Make}, Model: ${exif.Model}`)
    })
```
Note that the fields from ExifTool are [PascalCased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PascalCase), like `AFPointSelected` and `ISO`. This library does not "fix" them to camelCase (as this would result in ungainly `aFPointSelected` and `iSO` attrocities).

## Features

1. Uses `-stay_open` mode by default, which can make ExifTool up to 60x faster[*](#stay_open)

1. Proper parsing of 
    - dates
    - latitudes & longitudes
    - rational numbers as [fractions](https://github.com/ekg/fraction.js)

1. Auditable ExifTool source code (the "vendored" code can be [verified](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/checksums.txt))

1. Supported on node v6.7.0 on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

1. Build target to update ExifTool releases ([new versions come out monthly](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/history.html))

## stay_open

Spinning up the perl version of exiftool is expensive, but is *especially* expensive on the executible version on Windows. A *distribution of perl* is extracted and run out of a temporary directory from the self-extracting `exiftool.exe` archive for *every invocation*.

Without `-stay_open`, this approach is like dipping ExifTool in molasses, made worse because youâ€™re now  fighting your virus software as it scans through the thousands of files that encompass the majority of the perl5 interpreter and the entire code of ExifTool, just to fetch metadata for one file. With `-stay_open`, you only pay that cost once per node process.

## Not implemented

* thumbnail extraction
* any write operations

## Change history

Note that version numbers, other than the patch number, follow ExifTool's in the interests of simplicity.

### 10.29.0

Initial Release.
